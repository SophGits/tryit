### Closure

Re scope, their inner functions get access to the parameters and variables they're defined within - with the exception of `this` and `arguments`.

##### Example 1 (from http://javascript-roadtrip-part3.codeschool.com/levels/2/challenges/3)

<table style="font-family:Consolas, 'Liberation Mono'">
  <tbody>
    <tr style="vertical-align:top;">
      <td>
        <b>function</b> mystery( input ){<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>var</b> secret = 5;<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>function</b> mystery2 ( multiplier ) {<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;multiplier *= input;<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>return</b> secret * multiplier;<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>return </b>mystery2;<br/>
        }<br/>
        <br/>
        <b>var hidden = mystery(4);<br/>var result  = hidden(2);</b>
      </td>
      <td>multiplier is 2 <br/>input is 4 <br /><br/>
      result is same as hidden(2), which is 40;
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


##### Example 2 (from Codeschool)
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <b>function</b> mystery ( input ){  <br/>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>var</b> secret = 4;  <br/>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;input+=2;  <br/>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>function</b> mystery2 ( multiplier ) {   <br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;multiplier *= input;  <br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return secret * multiplier;  <br/>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;}  <br/>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>return</b> mystery2;  <br/>
        }  <br/>
        <b>function</b> mystery3 ( param ){  <br/>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>function</b> mystery4 ( bonus ){  <br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>return</b> param(6) + bonus;  <br/>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;}  <br/>
         &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>return</b> mystery4;  <br/>
        }
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>var hidden = mystery(3);<br/>
        <b>var jumble = mystery3(hidden);<br/>
        <b>var result = jumble(2);</b><br/>
      </td>
      <td>
       result = jumble(2)<br />
       = mystery3(hidden)(2)<br />
       = mystery3( mystery(3) )(2)<br /><br />
       So <b>bonus = 2</b> (wihin mystery4)<br /><br />
       mystery3(param) is mystery3(hidden).<br />so hidden = param, <br/><br/>and since hidden = mystery(3),<br/> param(6) = hidden(3)(6).<br/>So 6 is fed into mystery's internal function (ie <b>multiplier = 6</b>)<br />
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

So, here we input the values:

```javascript
function mystery ( input = 3 ){
  var secret = 4;
  input+=2; // 3 + 2 = 5
  function mystery2 ( multiplier = 6 ) { //
    multiplier *= input;  // multiplier = 6 * 5 = 30
    return secret * multiplier;  // 4 * 30 = 120  (apparently this is param(6) rather than just param)
  }
  return mystery2;
}
```
Then,

```javascript
function mystery3 ( param ){
  function mystery4 ( bonus = 2 ){
    return param(6) + bonus;    // 120 + 2 = 122
  }
  return mystery4;
}
```

> result is 122

##### A note on scope (from Crockford)
Most languages with C syntax have block scope, but JS doesn't. It has function scope - ie parameters and variables defined in a function arent't visible outside of it. In modern languages it is recommended that variables be declared as late as possible, at the first point of use - but because JavaScipt lacks block scope you should declare all variables used in a function at the top of a function body.

---

##### Loops within closure
###### Bad loop example
```javascript
var fruits = ['banana', 'apple', 'orange'];
var numberFruits = function(fruits){
  var i;
  for(i=0; i < fruits.length; i+=1) {
      $('cite').after("<div id='fruitcontainer' style='background:pink; height: 2em; width: 100%;'></div>");
      $('#fruitcontainer').after("<div style='color:orange;background:aliceblue;' class ='yo'>HI_THERE " + fruits + "</div>");
      var domfruits = $('.yo');
      domfruits[i].onclick = function(){
        console.log(i);
     };
  }
};
numberFruits(fruits);
```
NB: Do it in the console of Modernizr.com because the DOM element "cite" is nice and obvious.<br />
Now click on anything created and you'll only ever get 3 console logged, on the third item.

The above is meant to give each fruit a number, `i`, but instead the handler functions are bound to the variable `i`, not the value of `i` at the time the function was made.

###### Better loop example
A better verison is:
(NB: run it after the above)

```javascript
var numberFruits2 = function(){
   var helper = function(i){
     return function(){
        alert(i);
     };
   };
 var domfruits = $('.yo');
  var i;
  for(i=0;i < domfruits.length; i+=1){
    domfruits[i].onclick = helper(i);
  }
}
```
Now you can see that the alert gives the actual index of each clicked dom element.

###### Another loop example
Wrong:

```javascript
var sharkList = ["Bob", "Maisy", "Fred", "Bill",
 "Norma", "Sharif", "Muhammed", "Jean"]
```
```javascript
function assignNumber( shark, sharkList ){
  var numberAssignment;
  for(var i = 0; i < sharkList.length; i++){
    if(shark == sharkList[i]){
      numberAssignment = function(){
        console.log("Hey, " + shark + " - You are number " + i +".");
      };
    }
  }
  return numberAssignment;
}
```
```javascript
assignNumber("Maisy", sharkList)();
```
The intention is for each shark to get a number correlating with their position in the array. But here, they all get assigned the final number. As you can see if you try with Maisy, she gets 8. Same with Bob.


To clear it up you just get rid of numberAssignment:

```javascript
function assignNumber( shark, sharkList ){
  for(var i = 1; i < sharkList.length; i++){
    if(shark == sharkList[i]){
      return function(){
        console.log("Hey, " + shark + " - You are number " + i +".");
      };
    }
  }
}
```

###### At the point of closure

Closures bind values at the very last moment, so be careful of return times and variable states.

```javascript
var listOfPeople = ["Bonnie", "Angel", "Clara", "Dean", "Matthew"];
```
```javascript
function assignNumber(name, people){
  var numberAssignment;
  for (var i=0; i < people.length; i++){
    if(people[i] == name){
      numberAssignment = function(){
        console.log("Hey, " + name + " your number is: " + i + ".");
      };
    }
  }
  return numberAssignment;
}
```
```javascript
var giveNumber = assignNumber("Clara", listOfPeople);
giveNumber();
```
> Clara will get 6...as will Bonnie, Dean, and everyone else.

The function's actual `return` is the true "moment of closure", when the environment and all necessary variables are packaged up. <br />
So i is returned in the `return numberAssignment`, where it's already at 5 (the for loop has cycled and stopped by then).<br />

1. We could do this:

```javascript
function assignNumber(name, people){
  for (var i=0; i < people.length; i++){
    if(people[i] == name){
      return function(){
        console.log("Hey, " + name + " your number is: " + i + ".");
      };
    }
  };
}
```
Get rid of the numberAssigment altogether and return a function expression straight away (as soon as the person is found) and lock `i` into place so it is not allowed to progress.

2. We could also do this:

```javascript
function makeNumberAssigner(people){
  return function(name){
    for (var i=0; i < people.length; i++){
      if(people[i] == name){
        console.log("Hey, " + name + " your number is: " + i + ".");
      }
    };
  }
}
```
We only pass the array to the function, because name is getting passed to the function expression inside.

NB the `people` array is getting passed inside the function expression, binding it to the closure in whatever form it was in when it got passed into `makeNumberAssigner`.

In the above, the loop is inside the returned function and `i` will come straight from that local scope. The only closed variable from the external scope is the `people` array, which never changes anyway.

```javascript
var getNumberFor = makeNumberAssigner(people);
getNumberFor("Dean");
```

###### Functions creating scope
```
var x = 6
function ass(a, b){
  var x = a + b;
  return x;
}

add(9,2); // outputs 11
console.log(x) // outputs 6
```
The second `var x` only exists in the function's local scope. Because it's been declared with `var` it doesn't modify the variable of the same name 'outside' the function.

In the below, the inner `x` has not been declared with `var` and therefore "shadows" the same-named variable from the nearest external scope.

```
var x = 6;
function add(a, b){
  x = a + b;
  return x;
}

add(9,2); // outputs 11
console.log(x) // outputs 11
```

##### Initialising an instance
Instead of initialising myObject with an object literal, do it by calling a function which returns one:

```javascript
var myObject = (function(){
  var value = 0;✝

  return{
    increment: function(inc){
      value += typeof inc === 'number' ? inc : 1;
    },
    getValue: function(){
      return value;
    }
  };
}());
```
✝. This value variable is always available to the `increment` and `getValue` methods, but the function's scope keeps it hidden from the rest of the programme.
> myObject >> Object {increment: function, getValue: function}

We are assigning to myObject the result of invoking a function. The function returns an object containing two methods, which continue to enjoy access to the `value` variable.

#### Quo Eg 1 of 2
```javascript
var Quo = function(string)✡{
  this.status = string;
}
✝Quo.prototype.get_status = function(){
  return this.status;
};
✝✝var myQuo = new Quo("confused");
console.log(myQuo.get_status()); //confused
```
✡. Create a constructor function called Quo. It makes an object with a `status` property.<br />
✝. Give all instances of Quo a public method called `get_status`.<br />
✝✝. Make an instance of Quo.


#### Quo Eg 2 of 2
```javascript
✡var quo = function(status){
  return{
    get_status: function(){
      return status;
    }
  };
};
✝var myQuo = quo("amazed");
console.log(myQuo.get_status()); //amazed
```
✡. Create a maker function called quo. It makes an object with a `get_status` method and a private status property.<br />
✝. Make an instance of quo.<br />

This quo function is designed to be used without the `new` prefix, so the name isn't capitalised. Calling `quo` returns a new object containing a `get_status` method.
A reference to that object is stored in myQuo. The `get_status` method still has privileged access to quo's `status` property even though `quo` has already returned.

##### Incrementing
```javascript
function warningMaker( obstacle ){
  var count = 0;
  return function ( number, location ) {
  count +=1;
    console.log("Beware! There have been " + obstacle + " sightings in the Cove today!\n" + number + " " + obstacle + "(s) spotted at the " + location + "!\nThis is Alert #" + count + " today for " + obstacle + " danger."
    );
  };
}

var icebergAlert = warningMaker("iceberg");
icebergAlert(7, "Charlton");
```
See how this keeps track of the number of times an alert has been called. The internal count +=1 goes up even though the scope is bound to that inner function. Keep calling icebergAlert(number, location) and see.

###### Incrementing II (same thing, but with an array as well)

```javascript
function warningMaker( obstacle ){
  var count = 0;
  var zones = [];
  return function ( number, location ) {
    count++;
    zones.push(location);
    var list = "";
    for(var i = 0; i < zones.length; i++){
        list = list + "\n" + zones[i];
    }
    console.log("There have been " +
    obstacle + " sightings in the Cove today!\n" + number + " " + obstacle + "(s) spotted at the " + location + "!\n" + "This is Alert #" + count +
    " today for " + obstacle + " danger.\n" + "Current danger zones are:" +
    list
   );
  };
}
var sharkAlert = warningMaker("shark");
sharkAlert(5, "Greenwich");
sharkAlert(5, "Woolwich");
```
> Prints:
> sharkAlert(5, "Greenwich");
> sharkAlert(5, "Woolwich");
>
> There have been shark sightings in the Cove today!
5 shark(s) spotted at the Greenwich!
This is Alert #1 today for shark danger.
Current danger zones are:
Greenwich
>
>There have been shark sightings in the Cove today!
5 shark(s) spotted at the Woolwich!
This is Alert #2 today for shark danger.
Current danger zones are:
Greenwich
Woolwich

###### Will always alert 3

```javascript
var a = {}
for(var i=0; i<3; i++){
  a[i] = function(){
    alert(i)
  };
}
a[0]();
a[1]();
a[2]();
```
###### Unless you add more closure:

```javascript
var a = {}
for(var i=0; i<3; i++){

  (function(j){
    a[j] = function(){
      alert(j)
    };
  })(i);

}
a[0]();
a[1]();
a[2]();
```

##### Almost identical example
```javascript
var nums = [1,2,3];
for (var i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
  // This variable keeps changing every time we iterate!
  //  First value is 1, then 2, then finally 3.
  var num = nums[i];

  elem.addEventListener('click', function() {
      // alert num's value at the moment of the click!
      alert(num);

      // Specifically, we're alerting the num variable
      // that's defined outside of this inner function.
      // Each of these inner functions are pointing to the
      // same `num` variable... the one that changes on
      // each iteration, and which equals 3 at the end of
      // the for loop.  Whenever the anonymous function is
      // called on the click event, the function will
      //  reference the same `num` (which now equals 3).

  });
}
```
The above code is essentially this:
```javascript
var num = nums[i];
elem.addEventListener('click', function() {
  alert(num);
});
```
To fix it, add an IIFE:
```javascript
  elem.addEventListener('click', (function(numCopy) {
      return function() {
          alert(numCopy)
      };
  })(num));
```
and pass `num` into the outer function. Inside that outer function, the value is known as `numCopy` - a copy of `num` in that instant. Now it doesn't matter that num changes later down the line, as the value of `num` in `numCopy` is stored inside the outer function.

Finally, the outer function returns the inner function to the event listener. Because of the way JavaScript scope works, that inner function has access to `numCopy`. In the near future, `num` will increment, but that doesn't matter. The inner function has access to `numCopy`, which will never change.

Now, when someone clicks, it'll execute the returned inner function, alerting `numCopy`.

Here's an example to paste in the console of a browser:
```
// clear the screen for testing
document.body.innerHTML = '';

var nums = [1,2,3];

// Let's loop over the numbers in our array
for (var i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {

    // This is the number we're on...
    var num = nums[i];

    // We're creating a DOM element for the number
    var elem = document.createElement('div');
    elem.textContent = num;

    // ... and when we click, alert the value of `num`
    elem.addEventListener('click', (function(numCopy) {
        return function() {
            alert(numCopy);
        };
    })(num));

    document.body.appendChild(elem);
};
```
